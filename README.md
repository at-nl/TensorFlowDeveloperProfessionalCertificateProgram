# TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate Program

This repository documents my learning and progress in 2022 in Coursera's [Tensor Flow Developer Professional Certificate Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/deeplearning-ai).

The certificate program consists of 4 courses, each of which has its own subdirectory in this repository:
1. [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
2. [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
3. [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
4. [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
